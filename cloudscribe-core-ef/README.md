# Using cloudscribe Core and Entity Framework Core

This sample uses [cloudscribe Core](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe) for user authentication and Entity Framework/SqlServer storage for content and data.

[cloudscribe Core](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe) is a multi-tenant web application foundation. It provides multi-tenant identity management for sites, users, and roles.

When you run it from Visual Studio it should initilaize a new localdb on the first run. 

You can login with admin@admin.com as the username and admin as the password

Be sure to update the credentials before deployment.
